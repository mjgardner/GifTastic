# GifTastic

This app exercises the [GIPHY API](https://developers.giphy.com/) by
presenting a series of clickable buttons representing TV shows; clicking
one of these causes the app to search GIPHY's library of animated GIFs
for that show. The GIFs initially load as still images; to make them animate,
click on them once to start and again to stop.

You can also add to the list of shows by typing in your favorite in the "Add
a topic" field; clicking "Submit" will then add your button to the list and
search GIPHY for that show.
